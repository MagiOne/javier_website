	<h5> MSc projects </h5>
<p> 
Every year we accept several students from the Vehicle Engineering track and BioRobotics specialization within the MSc Mechanical Engineering. In exceptional cases, we also supervise students from other MSc studies - if you are interested please see below the information that we require from you.
 <br>
In the following you can find a list of available MSc projects, with starting date. Please first contact the daily supervisor to discuss the project.
</p>

<!----     INSTRUCTIONS      ------>
<!----
FOR NEW PROJECTS:
Copy the text below, paste it at the TOP and fill it in with the information of your project.
PLEASE LEAVE A SEPARATION BETWEEN PROJECTS!
Put yourself as the daily supervisor, with email address.
Make sure that the link to the pdf works and the pdf is in the same folder.
Only use the external collaborators field if there are any.

IF YOUR PROJECT IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE:
- IF IT IS TAKEN:
--- MOVE IT TO PAST PROJECTS (thesis_past)
--- MOVE THE PDF DESCTIPTION INSIDE OLD/
--- ADD THE NAME OF THE STUDENT AND STARTING DATE!
- ELSE: Delete it.

<h5> Applications </h5>
<p>
We can occasionally accommodate (additional) highly motivated students in MSc projects or in ongoing projects before their graduation stage.
 <br>
 <br>
If you are interested in working on a project with us, please send us ca. 1 academic quarter before the intended starting date an e-mail including:
 <br>
- a short CV (Â½ - 1 page) <br>
- BSc & MSc transcripts <br>
- a short motivation letter <br>
- BSc thesis (PDF) <br>
- any other information that might be relevant for the application
 <br>
 <br>
The motivation letter should state: <br>
- what are you interested in? What would you like to achieve?<br>
- the type of assignment you are interested in (more theoretical/more applied)<br>
- whether you prefer a project at the TU or at a company<br>
- the intended starting date<br>
- your relevant experience (studies, technical projects, internships, hobbies, etc.)<br>
- programming languages and related (C, C++, Python, ROS, etc.)
</p>
