		In the near future mobile robots, such as personal
		robots or mobile manipulators, will share the workspace
		with other robots and humans. We present a method for
		mission and motion planning that applies to small teams
		of robots performing a task in an environment with moving
		obstacles, such as humans.   
        <span id="list"><a href="#list" class="show">
        ...expand...
		</a> <span>
        Given a mission specification
		written in linear temporal logic, such as patrolling a set of rooms, we synthesize an automaton from which the robots
		can extract valid strategies. This centralized automaton is
		executed by the robots in the team at runtime, and in conjunction
		with a distributed motion planner that guarantees
		avoidance of moving obstacles. Our contribution is a correct by-construction
		synthesis approach to multi-robot mission
		planning that guarantees collision avoidance with respect
		to moving obstacles, guarantees satisfaction of the mission
		specification and resolves encountered deadlocks, where a
		moving obstacle blocks the robot temporally. Our method
		provides conditions under which deadlock will be avoided by
		identifying environment behaviors that, when encountered
		at runtime, may prevent the robot team from achieving its
		goals. In particular, (1) it identifies deadlock conditions; (2)
		it is able to check whether they can be resolved; and (3) the
		robots implement the deadlock resolution policy locally in
		a distributed manner. The approach is capable of synthesizing
		and executing plans even with a high density of dynamic
		obstacles. In contrast to many existing approaches to mission
		and motion planning, it is scalable with the number of
		moving obstacles. We demonstrate the approach in physical
		experiments with walking humanoids moving in 2D environments
		and in simulation with aerial vehicles (quadrotors)
		navigating in 2D and 3D environments.
